# Basic Web App Template based on Webpack 5.0

This is just a basic web app template I use when I learn new JavaScript libraries. Not intended to use in production.

## Getting started
- clone repo using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit). You might need to install `degit` first - `npm install -g degit`. Then `degit nyinyithann/WebAppMinimalTemplate` to clone this repo. Then run the following commands.
- `yarn install` 
- `yarn start`
